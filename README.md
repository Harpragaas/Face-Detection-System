# Face-Detection-System

Developed a Face Detection system using the eigenface algorithm.The essence of eigenfaces is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called Principal Components Analysis (PCA) that we use to reduce the dimensionality of images into something smaller. Now that we have a smaller representation of our faces, we apply a classifier that takes the reduced-dimension input and produces a class label.

Folder : 
Code : contains the M files , "main_code" is the file you need to run
Images.zip : contains the training and testing images used in the project

Running the code :
Download the code, trainingset and testingset folders
Open the "main_code.m" file change the directories for trainingset and testingset accordingly
Run the "main_code.m"
